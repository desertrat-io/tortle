# Tortle

A portal to your piece of the web

## What's it all about?

Tortle is an idea that came to me while I was looking for something similar to iGoogle, but modern and not...sunset
forever. There were some paid options out there that sort of did what I was looking for, but really were just glorified
RSS readers wrapped in a pretty (sometimes not) website.

Thing is, I wanted something more flexible, more robust, more useful. I wanted something that would be a great addition
to any browser setup with a default page for a new tab.

## Tech Stuff

Tortle is built (as of writing) on:

- PHP 8.0
- Laravel 8.*
- Livewire
- Postgres
- TailwindCSS
- Vue

I opted to not use Alpine.js for personal preference reasons.
